# **BuyMart - Online Shopping Application**

## **Project Overview**

**BuyMart** is a scalable, microservices-based online shopping platform, built to provide users with an engaging, seamless shopping experience. The application features user registration, product listings, shopping carts, order processing, and payment integrations. The architecture is modular, with each component encapsulated as a microservice, enabling high scalability and independent development.

## **Phases of Development**

### **Phase 1: Project Planning and Setup**

**Goal**: Establish a solid foundation for development by defining the features, tech stack, repositories, and architecture.

#### **Key Tasks**:

1. **Define Core Features**: 
   - User registration and login.
   - Product listing, search, and categories.
   - Shopping cart functionality.
   - Checkout and order placement.
   - Order history and tracking.
   - Optional payment integration.

2. **Technology Stack Confirmation**:
   - Backend: **Java 17**, **Spring Boot**, **Spring Security**, **Spring Data JPA**.
   - Frontend: **React.js**, **Material UI**.
   - Database: **PostgreSQL** (for relational data), **MongoDB** (for non-relational data, if needed).
   - Communication: **RabbitMQ** for inter-service communication.
   - Containerization: **Docker**, **Kubernetes** (for cloud deployment).
   - CI/CD: **GitHub Actions**.

3. **Create Repositories and Organization**:
   - Create a GitHub Organization (e.g., BuyMart).
   - Create separate repositories for each microservice (user-service, product-service, cart-service, order-service, etc.).
   - Set up Git branching strategy (main, develop, feature, hotfix).

4. **Project Roadmap**:
   - Plan the timeline for development, testing, deployment, and scaling.
   - Allocate milestones for each feature and phase of the project.

5. **Development Environment Setup**:
   - Set up local development environments (Java, Docker, Node.js, PostgreSQL).
   - Ensure consistency across team environments (IDE setup, version control, etc.).

6. **Documentation**:
   - Create initial documentation covering project setup, tech stack, and guidelines for contributing.

### **Phase 2: Microservice Development**

**Goal**: Develop core microservices and integrate them to form the base functionality of the platform.

#### **Key Tasks**:

1. **Service Development**:
   - **User Service**: Implement authentication, registration, and profile management using Spring Security.
   - **Product Service**: Implement CRUD operations for products, product search, and category management.
   - **Cart Service**: Implement shopping cart functionality (add, remove, update items).
   - **Order Service**: Implement order placement, order tracking, and history management.

2. **Service Communication**:
   - Set up **RabbitMQ** or another message broker for asynchronous communication between services.
   - Integrate services via REST APIs or messaging queues as needed.

3. **Database Integration**:
   - Set up **PostgreSQL** for relational data storage.
   - Implement database schemas for users, products, orders, and other relevant entities.

4. **Frontend Development**:
   - **React.js** application for the user interface.
   - Implement responsive design using **Material UI** or **Ant Design**.
   - Integrate frontend with backend services via RESTful APIs.

### **Phase 3: Payment Integration (Optional)**

**Goal**: Integrate payment gateway to process transactions for order payments.

#### **Key Tasks**:

1. **Choose a Payment Gateway**:
   - Integrate with popular services like **Stripe**, **PayPal**, or any other suitable payment API.

2. **Develop Payment Service**:
   - Implement the backend service to handle payment processing, order confirmation, and transaction history.
   - Securely store payment information (use tokenization or other secure methods).

3. **Integrate Frontend**:
   - Allow users to select payment methods and complete payments securely.

---

### **Phase 4: Dockerization and CI/CD**

**Goal**: Containerize microservices for consistency and implement CI/CD for automated testing and deployment.

#### **Key Tasks**:

1. **Dockerize Microservices**:
   - Create Dockerfiles for each microservice, ensuring all dependencies are included in the container.
   - Build Docker images and run containers locally for testing.

2. **Set Up Kubernetes**:
   - Deploy Docker containers to a Kubernetes cluster for orchestration and scaling.
   - Use Helm for easier management of Kubernetes resources.

3. **Implement CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Set up **GitHub Actions** for automating builds, tests, and deployments.
   - Integrate the pipeline with **Docker** and **Kubernetes** for a smooth deployment flow.

---

### **Phase 5: Testing and Quality Assurance**

**Goal**: Ensure the application is stable, functional, and secure through rigorous testing.

#### **Key Tasks**:

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for all business logic and API endpoints.
   - Use tools like **JUnit** (for Java), **Mockito**, and **JUnit 5** for mocking dependencies.

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test the communication between microservices (e.g., using **Postman** or **RestAssured**).
   - Validate the data flow across services.

3. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Test the entire application flow (from login to checkout) to ensure the system works as expected.

4. **Security Testing**:
   - Ensure authentication, authorization, and payment transactions are secure.
   - Use tools like **OWASP ZAP** for penetration testing.

---

### **Phase 6: Deployment and Monitoring**

**Goal**: Deploy the application to production and monitor its performance.

#### **Key Tasks**:

1. **Production Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application to a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure) using **Kubernetes** for orchestration.
   - Configure environment variables and services (databases, message brokers).

2. **Set Up Monitoring**:
   - Use monitoring tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to monitor the health of microservices and the overall application.
   - Set up logging (e.g., using **ELK Stack**: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for better visibility.

3. **Scale Services**:
   - Set up auto-scaling rules in Kubernetes to handle traffic spikes.
   - Use horizontal pod autoscaling to maintain performance.

### **Phase 7: Post-Launch and Optimization**

**Goal**: After the launch, monitor, optimize, and scale the application as required.

#### **Key Tasks**:

1. **Bug Fixing and Updates**:
   - Address any issues reported by users or discovered in post-launch testing.
   - Update the application with any feature requests or improvements.

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize database queries, API responses, and frontend performance.
   - Monitor load and response times, and scale infrastructure as needed.

3. **User Feedback**:
   - Gather feedback from users and identify areas for future development or new features.
   - Plan iterative releases based on feedback.
